# kinect4unreal-godrays
a simple kinect project using the unreal engine I made for halloween this year

Requires 4.20.3

This includes the example file from the unreal market place, as well as 3 examples from me.

EmptyMap: demo's 6 different tracked skeletons using the mannequin

# Yes I realized these files have typos lol, Ill fix next time I touch this project
godray_opcaity: The halloween demo I made. Uses the kinect depth camera to mask a material in front of the camera which creates bright godrays

godray_opcaity_webcam: The same godray effect, but this uses a normal camera (webcam or mobile camera) as an additional example.
